## **Propagation** is the way...

## Today's Topics

- Driving force and equilibrium potential
- Action potential propagation

## Driving force and equilibrium potential

- "Driving Force" on a given ion depends on its equilibrium potential.
- Driving force larger if membrane potential far from equilibrium potential for ion.
- *Equilibrium potential*
    + Voltage that keeps current (inside/outside) concentrations the same
    + Voltage membrane potential will approach if **only** that ion flows

## [Equilibrium potentials calculated](http://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/nernst_potential_calculator.html) under typical conditions

| Ion | [inside]  | [outside]    | Voltage    |
|-----|-----------|--------------|------------|
| K+  | ~150 mM   | ~4 mM        | ~ -90 mV    |
| Na+ | ~10 mM    | ~140 mM      | ~ +55-60 mV |
| Cl- | ~10 mM    | ~110 mM      | - 65-80 mV  |

## AP propagation

- Propagation
    + move down axon, away from soma, toward axon terminals.
- Unmyelinated axon
    + Each segment "excites" the next
    
## AP propagation is like

## AP propagation

- Myelinated axon
    + AP "jumps" between Nodes of Ranvier, *saltatory conduction*
    + Nodes of Ranvier == unmyelinated sections of axon
    + voltage-gated Na+, K+ channels exposed
    + Current flows through myelinated segments
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + **Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.**
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + **Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.**

## Information processing

- AP amplitudes don't vary (much)
    + All or none
- AP frequency and timing vary
    + Rate vs. timing codes
