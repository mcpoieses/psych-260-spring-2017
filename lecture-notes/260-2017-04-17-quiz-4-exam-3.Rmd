## V1 has laminar, columnar organization

- Columns
    + Color/wavelength
    + Eye of origin, *ocular dominance*
    
## Ocular dominance columns

</div>

## Beyond V1

- Larger, more complex receptive fields
- *Dorsal stream* (where/how)
    + Toward parietal lobe
- *Ventral stream* (what)

## What is vision for?

- What is it? (form perception)
- Where is it? (space perception)
- How do I get from here to there (action control)
- What time (or time of year) is it?
