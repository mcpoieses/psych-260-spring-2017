## Action

- Monosynaptic stretch reflex
- Intrafusal/extrafusal muscle fibers
    - Extrafusal == produce force
    - Intrafusal == take up slack in muscle spindles
- Parkinson's, Huntington's
- Wolpert's ideas about role of brains in movement planning

## Somatosensation

- Functional segregation
    - Different receptors detect different qualities/dimensions
- Similarities to, differences from vision, audition
- Relation between sensitivity, receptor density, receptive field size, and corresponding cortical area.
    - Higher sensitivity == > density, < receptive field size, > cortical area size

## Disorders

- Serotonin/monoamine hypothesis of depression, treatments
- Treatments for bipolar disorder
- Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia & alternative

## Emotion

- Plutchik
- Fear, stress circuits
- Reward/happiness circuits

## Sleep

- Suprachiasmatic Nucleus, melatonin

## Hormones

- Oxytocin
- Cortisol

## Neuroanatomy

- Ventricles
- Lobes of the cerebral cortex
- Parts of the brain

## Neurophysiology

- Resting, action potentials
- Postsynaptic potentials, end plate potential (muscle fiber)

## Next time

- Exam 3
