Action
------

-   Monosynaptic stretch reflex
    -   Also called "myotatic"
    -   Polysynaptic component
-   Intrafusal/extrafusal muscle fibers
    -   Extrafusal == produce force
    -   Intrafusal == take up slack in muscle spindles
-   Parkinson's, Huntington's
-   Wolpert's ideas about role of brains in movement planning

Somatosensation
---------------

-   Functional segregation
    -   Different receptors detect different qualities/dimensions
-   What information projects to brain fastest & why?
    -   Thick axons & thick myelin -&gt; proprioception from muscle spindles
-   Similarities to, differences from vision, audition
-   Relation between sensitivity, receptor density, receptive field size, and corresponding cortical area.
    -   Higher sensitivity == &gt; density, &lt; receptive field size, &gt; cortical area size

Disorders
---------

-   Serotonin/monoamine hypothesis of depression, treatments
-   Treatments for bipolar disorder
-   Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia & alternative

Emotion
-------

-   Plutchik
-   Fear, stress circuits
-   Reward/happiness circuits
    -   Milner & Olds stimulation experiment

Sleep
-----

-   Suprachiasmatic nucleus, melatonin

Hormones
--------

-   Oxytocin
-   Cortisol

Evolution
---------

-   Relative brain sizes among mammals

Neuroanatomy
------------

-   Ventricles
-   Lobes of the cerebral cortex
-   Parts of the brain

Neurophysiology
---------------

-   Resting, action potentials
-   Postsynaptic potentials, end plate potential (muscle fiber)
-   Role of Ca++ in
    -   Synaptic communication
    -   Muscular contraction
